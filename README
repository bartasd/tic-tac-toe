# Tic Tac Toe

## ðŸŒŸ About

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project! This version introduces several exciting new features:

- **Custom Player Names**: You can now input and save custom names for players.
- **Persistent Scores**: Player scores are retained regardless of name entry order (e.g., A:B or B:A) and case (e.g., "John" or "JOHN").
- **Score Initialization**: New names start with a score of 0:0 when first entered.
- **Player Switching**: After each game, you can switch players while scores remain separate and intact.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals

I have some exciting plans for future updates:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game looks great on all devices.
- **Personalized Design**: Tailor the design to better fit my needs and preferences.
- **Additional Features**: Implement any new, innovative features that come to mind.
- **Timing Mechanisms**: Possibly add timing elements to enhance gameplay.
- **Community Ideas**: I welcome suggestions and ideas from the community.
- **Code Improvement**: Strive for cleaner, more efficient code.
