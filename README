# TIC TAC TOE

## ðŸŒŸ About

The purpose of this project is to implement some new features.<br>
New features added:

- You can input your names
- Score associated with two names are retained, no matter the order you enter those: A:B or B:A
- Score remains associated with two names even if you enter: "John" or "JOHN".
- Beginning score with one or both new names (non-existing in localStorage) are always 0:0
- Added possibility to change Players after a gameplay - scores are separated as usually...

## ðŸŽ¯ Future goals

- Responsive design
- Design adapted to my needs
- Any unthough featuers still to add...
- Maybe some timing features???
- Any ideas - share those with me.
- CLEANER CODE ...
